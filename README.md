# **🌐 Dynamics of Olson's Model: An ABM Exploration**

## **🔍 Overview**
Explore the intricate dynamics of political and economic behavior with **Dynamics of Olson's Model: An ABM Exploration**. Our simulation, developed in NetLogo, offers an immersive dive into Mancur Olson's Roving vs. Stationary Bandits Theory, providing a unique lens to view wealth distribution and bandit behavior in varying conditions.

## **📚 Olson's Model: Key Theories**
Olson's theory postulates two types of bandits - roving and stationary. Roving bandits plunder wealth without concern for the long-term consequences, while stationary bandits act with less myopically, balancing their plundering (taxation) with the welfare of the taxed. This model offers a nuanced view of governance, economy, and societal interactions, setting the stage for our simulation.

## **📊 Model Description**
Our ABM simulation vividly brings to life the behaviors and decisions of both roaming and stationary bandits:
- **Agents**: Representing roving and stationary bandits, each with unique strategies and impacts on their territories.
- **Patches**: Simulating territories that bandits interact with, each possessing distinct wealth and growth potential.

## **🌟 Scenarios**
### Baseline Scenario
A foundational setting where bandits operate under default parameters, establishing a benchmark for behavior and wealth distribution.

### [Additional Scenarios]
Detail Specific Scenarios conditions and modifications to explore different 'What If' Scenarios based on Olson's theory.

## **💡 Analysis**
Our simulation generates rich data, allowing for a comprehensive analysis of bandit strategies, wealth distribution, and territorial dynamics. It's a powerful tool for understanding the practical ramifications of theoretical models in political economics.

## **🚀 Future Model Updates**
Looking ahead, we plan to introduce more complexity into our simulation to further test and challenge Olson's theory:
- **Enhanced Decision-Making Algorithms**: For more sophisticated bandit behavior and interactions.
- **Complex Territorial Dynamics**: Introducing more nuanced growth and investment opportunities for territories.
- **Deeper Economic Variables**: To simulate a broader range of economic factors and their impact on the model.
